                I did not expect anything much from this movie since this is Bollywood. But still I went for it because
                there is
                Hrithik Roshan and the fighter jet scenes could excite us.

            <blockquote>
                The jet visuals were good to watch though the CGI could have been better as always. The characters were
                little dark
                even though everything was shown I was unable to connect with the vibes.
